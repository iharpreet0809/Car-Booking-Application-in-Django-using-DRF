## Car Booking Application in Django Using DRF
This project is a RESTful API-based car booking system built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It allows users to browse available cars, book cars for specific dates, and manage their bookings efficiently.

The backend handles user authentication, car inventory management, booking creation, and availability checks through well-structured API endpoints. The system ensures smooth booking workflows and prevents double-booking by validating date overlaps.

Ideal for learning how to build scalable, secure, and maintainable APIs with Django and DRF while implementing real-world booking logic.
